# UPI PhonePe Integration

## Issue Addressed

The UPI redirection functionality has been enhanced to ensure better compatibility with PhonePe and other UPI apps, with a fallback to the PhonePe business website when direct app redirection fails.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced UPI Redirection Logic (src/pages/checkout.jsx)
- Added app-specific deep links for major UPI apps including PhonePe
- Implemented fallback mechanism to redirect to PhonePe business website
- Improved error handling with detailed payment options

### 2. Updated UPI Test Page (src/pages/upi-test.jsx)
- Added same enhanced redirection logic as checkout page
- Included PhonePe business website redirection as fallback
- Enhanced user instructions and feedback

## Technical Improvements

### Multiple Redirection Approaches:
1. **Standard UPI Intents**:
   - `upi://pay?pa=[UPI_ID]&pn=[Payee Name]&am=[Amount]&cu=INR&tn=[Transaction Note]`
   - Alternative formats for better compatibility

2. **App-Specific Deep Links**:
   - PhonePe: `phonepe://pay?pa=[UPI_ID]&pn=[Payee Name]&am=[Amount]&cu=INR`
   - Google Pay: `tez://upi/pay?pa=[UPI_ID]&pn=[Payee Name]&am=[Amount]&cu=INR`
   - Paytm: `paytmmp://pay?pa=[UPI_ID]&pn=[Payee Name]&am=[Amount]&cu=INR`

3. **Fallback to PhonePe Business Website**:
   - When all UPI app redirections fail, users are redirected to https://business.phonepe.com/
   - Detailed payment instructions are shown to guide users

### Sequential Redirection Process:
1. Try standard UPI intents (3 different formats)
2. If standard intents fail, try app-specific deep links
3. If all methods fail, redirect to PhonePe business website
4. Show detailed payment instructions to user

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/checkout.jsx` - Enhanced UPI redirection logic with PhonePe integration
2. `src/pages/upi-test.jsx` - Updated UPI test page with same enhancements

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to checkout and select UPI payment method
2. Enter a valid UPI ID or use default
3. Click "Pay with UPI App"
4. If UPI app opens, complete payment there
5. If UPI app doesn't open, you'll be redirected to PhonePe business website
6. Alternatively, test via Account menu â†’ UPI Test

### UPI Apps:
- Google Pay
- PhonePe
