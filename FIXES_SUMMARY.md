# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes made to resolve the issues with the e-commerce application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Orders Page Syntax Error
**Problem**: The orders page had a syntax error due to improperly closed JSX in the new order success message.
**Solution**: Fixed the closing parenthesis for the newOrderId conditional render.

### 2. Category Name Mismatch
**Problem**: The category names in the CATEGORIES array didn't match the lowercase format used in the product data.
**Solution**: Updated all category names in the CATEGORIES array to be lowercase to match the product data:
- 'Electronics' → 'electronics'
- 'Fashion' → 'fashion'
- 'Groceries' → 'grocery'
- 'Home appliances' → 'home appliances'
- 'Health' → 'health'
- 'Books' → 'books'
- 'Sports' → 'sports'
- 'Toys' → 'toys'
- 'Automotive' → 'automotive'
- 'Beauty' → 'beauty'

### 3. Success Message Styling
**Problem**: The success messages on both the checkout and orders pages needed better styling and centering.
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the checkout success message with a modern card-based design
- Improved the orders page success message with better visual hierarchy
- Made both messages more prominent and centered on the page

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/orders.jsx` - Fixed syntax error in new order success message
2. `src/lib/products.js` - Updated category names to match product data format
